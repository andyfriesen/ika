        Each individual Script instance should be used for one, and only one entity, or the state
        will get all messed up.

        This method returns clone of the script; use this if you want many entities to use the same move script.
        '''

    '''
    Now, for defining the move script.
    Calling any of the following methods appends a command to the script.
    They all return a self reference, so you can just chain them along.

    eg.
    MyMoveScript = (movescript.Script()        # the beginning parenth causes python to ignore line breaks
        .MoveRight(16)  # move right 16 pixels
        .Wait(100)      # stop for 1 second
        .MoveLeft(16)   # left 16 pixels
        .Wait(100)      # wait for another second
        .Loop()         # repeat ad infinitum
        )

    Additionally, if you want to be a goof, you can add things to the script member yourself.  Just make
    sure that it will execute properly when given the entity as its only argument, and that it does what
    it needs to do.

    In theory, a grouping command (that would execute a subcommand), and a few subclasses to conditionally,
    and repeatedly execute some smaller list of scripts would be all that would be necessary to make this
    script setup thing turing complete. (woo?)
