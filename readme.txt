This stuff is all GPL.  Look at GNU.txt for all the details.
Bug me at tsb@verge-rpg.com if you have questions.

I have yet to hear of this compiling on any compiler other than MSVC6.  When I (or anyone else who wants to try) get around to making a Linux port, it'll have to be introduced to g++.  I hope they can be friends.
