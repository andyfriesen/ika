Technically speaking, the C++ portion of ika is GPLd in its entirety, but
if someone were to ask me really nicely, I would probably be easily convinced
to allow bits and pieces to be used under a different license, provided that
I am able to do so.

Bug me at andy@ikagames.com if you have questions.

As of this writing, ika compiles on MSVC7.0 and GCC3.x.  It may be possible to
backport it to MSVC6, but there isn't a really compelling reason to do so, since
you can get the MSVC7 compiler for free now.
