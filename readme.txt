This stuff is all GPL.  Look at GNU.txt for all the details.
Bug me at andy@ikagames.com if you have questions.

As of this writing, ika compiles on MSVC7.0 alone.  I suspect that, if it
doesn't compile with g++ out of the box, that it could without much work.
I'll check that at some point.  I could check MSVC6 at some point too.
