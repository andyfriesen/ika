/*
  Cross-Platform Thread Synchronization Shizat
  By Jake Stine of Divine Entertainment
  ----------------------------------------------
  I use the term cross-platform rather loosely for now since I've never tested this
  code on anything but the Win32 platform.

  Anyway, it uses the platform's default critical section/mutex API.  If the platform
  has none, then it uses basic dumb 'forbid flagging.'  -- set the flag, check the
  flag, unset the flag.

  Note:  The trouble with flagging is that something of the same thread cannot enter
  a forbidden code block, which would cause a lockup.  This should never really happen
  anyway - but it might if I made a booboo somewhere.
