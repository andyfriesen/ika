WinMapEd 0.99999 (that's 5 nines)

By Andy Friesen (aka tSB)

If I didn't suck so badly at documenting things, this'd be a comprehensive guide to using this here map editor.  Sucks huh? ;)

-----------------------
I. The Toolbar
-----------------------

The first 3 menu buttons should be pretty self-explanitory.  The next 9 are for layer visibility.  The '1' through '6' buttons correspond to the 6 tile layers any map potentially has.  'O' toggles the obstruction layer, 'N' toggles the zoNe grid, and 'E' shows or hides entity locations.  Click any of them to hide/show the layer.

You'll also see a black square around the active layer.  To change this, just hit the key on your keyboard that matches the picture on the button the closest.  (ie '3' will make layer 3 the active layer, and 'O' will let you edit obstructions)

II. Doing things
----------------

First, you should probably draw a few tiles. ;) Open up the 'Edit' drop down menu and select 'VSP'.  You'll see a pretty dull looking dialog, most likely.  Right click in there somewhere, and select 'Edit' from the popup menu that appears.

Welcome to TileEd.

Fiddle with this for a bit, I'll document it better later on, (both chronologically, and within this here file) until you make some spiffy nice tiles.  Be sure to exit TileEd with the 'Update VSP and Exit' option when you're through, or the changes won't 'stick'.

Once you've done that, you might notice that that big black window is actually a big-ol list of all the tiles in the current VSP.  Click one to make it the 'active' tile, which is to say that left clicks in the main window will place that tile on the active layer.
