<h1><blink>ALERT! (look, it's blinking. it's an alert.)</blink></h1>
<h2>I know you guys must be wondering what's going on. Well, ika is like a neglected red-headed stepchild. I kind of don't care about ikaredux anymore, but I may in the future. I'm volatile and lame. Anyhow, if you guys are using another board currently that I don't know about, or if you set one up temporarily (or maybe longer), please email me <a href="mailto:ttthrasher@yahoo.com">here</a> and say so. I'll put a huge link up here or maybe even redirect to it if it's good enough. Okay, that's all.  Sorry for the &lt;blink>.<br>

Make sure to read andy's message below, also.<br><br>

<p>ok, not really.</p>
<p>Turns out that sourceforge.net updated their MySQL services to version 4.1</p>
<p>Thing is, they gave us all warning to back our junk up and everything.  And I didn't notice it.  So, long story short, I screwed up, and as a result, a lot of stuff is gone.  I have an <i>old</i> backup of things that I will upload when I get the chance.  Sorry for the inconvenience.</p>
