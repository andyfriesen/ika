    ika.Map.Save
    ika.Video.DrawArc
    ika.Video.DrawLineList
    ika.Video.DrawTriangleList
    ika.Canvas.AlphaMask
    ika.Canvas.DrawLine
    ika.Canvas.DrawRect
    ika.Entity.spritewidth
    ika.Entity.spriteheight
    ika.Font.wordspacing
    ika.Font.linespacing
    ika.Font.StringHeight
    Reimplemented ika.Video.DrawEllipse; no longer uses "3d" ellipse so filled ellipses look normal now.
    Added ika.MultiplyBlend blendmode
    Added ika.PreserveBlend blendmode
    Fixed implementation of ika.Matte blendmode
    Changed doublesize to default to a nearest resize instead of bilinear.
    Added in new user.cfg option "filter". Setting "filter 1" will set doublesizer to use bilinear filtering.
    Fixed GetClipRect so it functions properly in doublesize mode.
    Map camera now centers on the center of the player's hotspot, instead of the top left.
    Implemented game.ika-game files, which stores game specific data. This supercedes the resolution settings in user.cfg for now.
    Renamed ika.Video.colours to ika.Video.colors. ika.Video.colours still exists but will be removed in the future.
    Map looping should work in all directions now.
