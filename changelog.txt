    Reimplemented ika.Video.DrawEllipse; no longer uses "3d" ellipse so filled ellipses look normal now.
    Added ika.MultiplyBlend blendmode
    Fixed implementation of ika.Matte blendmode
    Changed doublesize to default to a nearest resize instead of bilinear.
    Added in new user.cfg option "filter". Setting "filter 1" will set doublesizer to use bilinear filtering.
    Fixed GetClipRect so it functions properly in doublesize mode.
    Map camera now centers on the center of the player's hotspot, instead of the top left.
    
DLLs
    Updated to newest version of audiere, fixing sound slowdowns and Vista issues.
    Began to package DLLs with ika distributions.  No more 3rdparty zip.
